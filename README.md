# CaPCIV
California pavement condition information viewer

This is a data synchronizing and viewing tool I wrote for CalTrans when I was a postdoc at UC.  It was used in California's automated pavement condition surveys. The basic functions of CaPCIV include (1) synchronisation and display of all the raw data collected by the agency and by the APCS service providers, (2) flexible yet easy image manipulation and profile filtering and (3) generation of reports of distress classification and quantification.

The GUI was written in Visual Basic and some data processing functions were written in FORTRAN.
